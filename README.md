# Basic Computer

This python program simulates a basic computer with a simple instruction set.

# How to Use

Modify the instruction codes located in the memory addresses in the "program.txt" file.

The program starts at address 0x00 and executes each instruction.

When you have written a program in the "program.txt" file run the computer with the terminal command "python3 computer.py"

The computer will execute your program and generate an "output.txt" file with the final memory state of the program.

# Instructions
